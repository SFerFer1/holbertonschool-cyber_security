# Metasploit Workflow - Vulnerability Research & Exploitation
# This script documents the steps followed during the Metasploit exercise.

# Part 1:
# Metasploit framework was launched using msfconsole.

# Part 2:
# The exploit windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue was selected.
# A payload (windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) was configured.
# LHOST and LPORT were set accordingly.
# This step was documented using the notes command.

# Part 3:
# A payload was generated using msfvenom.
# Payload: linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
# Output format: ELF
# The payload was saved as payload.elf.
# This step was documented in Metasploit notes.

# Part 4:
# An auxiliary module (scanner/portscan/tcp) was used.
# The target host was 127.0.0.1.
# Open TCP ports were identified and stored in the Metasploit database.
# Results were exported to services.csv.

# End of workflow
